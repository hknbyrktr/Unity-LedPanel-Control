# 🔴 Unity LED Panel Control

This project is a **Bluetooth-controlled LED panel system** developed to wirelessly manage an **ESP32-based HUB12 LED panel**.  
The user interface is built with Unity, and the ESP32 directly controls the panel using an improved version of the DMD32 library.  
The system provides a customizable display experience with support for **text rendering**, **animations**, and **full Turkish character support**.

## 🔧 Setup

### Unity Interface (Application)

1. Open the project folder with [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/).
2. A Bluetooth package from GitHub suitable for ESP32 is integrated: [BlueUnity](https://github.com/bentalebahmed/BlueUnity).  
   Refer to the package for more details.
3. You can either build the application or run the ready-made [APK](Apk/LedPanelYöneticisi.apk).

> 💡 Data is transmitted between Unity and ESP32 via Bluetooth in 7-part packets (explained below).

---

### ESP32 (Hardware)

1. Use [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) or Arduino IDE to upload the `main.cpp` to your ESP32.
2. The improved version of the DMD32 library is located in the `lib/` folder.
3. Font files are available in the `fonts/` folder. Custom Turkish characters have been manually added in bitmap format.

> 💡 You can open the ESP32 project directly via [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) using the folder `LedPanelYoneticisi_Esp32`.

#### 🧰 Required Components

+ 1 × ESP32-DEVKITC-32
+ 1 × 16x32 Red LED Panel
+ 1 × Type-C to Type-C Cable
+ 2 × Breadboard (one is not enough)
+ 20 × Male-to-Female Jumper Wires
+ 1 × 10K Resistor
+ 2 × 330 Ohm Resistors
+ 1 × Push Button
+ 1 × Red LED
+ 1 × Blue LED
+ 1 × 3.3V Battery

## 🔠 Font Development

Turkish characters (`ğ, Ğ, ü, Ü, ş, Ş, ı, İ, ö, Ö, ç, Ç`) that were missing in the original font files  
(`Arial_Black_16_ISO_8859_1.h`, `SystemFont5x7.h`) have been manually added in bitmap format.

## 📡 Bluetooth Data Packet Structure

Data is transmitted in **7 parts** using Bluetooth. Example:

Meşhur Ali Dayı'nın Yeri@Cağ Kebap@30@3@True@5@5    --> To see this, you can draw a circle on the app screen with your finger.


| Part No |                Description                |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Scrolling Text                            |
| 2       | Static Text                               |
| 3       | Scrolling Speed                           |
| 4       | Scrolling Repeat Count                    |
| 5       | Enable Static Text Animation (True/False) |
| 6       | Static Text Display Duration              |
| 7       | Clock Display Duration                    |

The ESP32 parses this data and displays the appropriate animation and text on the panel.
